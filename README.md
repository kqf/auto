This is a set of scripts to speed up routine and repetitive tasks

## Examples
To install all dependencies on a fresh `ubuntu` instance use the cli.
First check if everything looks as expected:

```bash
cat <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kqf/auto/master/install/ubuntu.sh
```

then run the script

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kqf/auto/master/install/ubuntu.sh
```
